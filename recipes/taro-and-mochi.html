    <h3>What is taro and mochi?</h3>
    <p>Taro is a purple root vegetable, like a sweet potato, that is used in Asian recipes. 
        Taro, tapioca and rock sugar can be found in most Chinese grocery stores. 
        It's a traditional Asian dessert, and like most, it is like a sweet soup. 
        It can be served hot or cold.

    <p>Mochi is a glutinous rice treat that is hard to resist. 
        They used to be just eaten during New Year festivities but over the years, 
        people have consumed them at other times of the year and they have also become popular at parties.
